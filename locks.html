<h3>What are the Locks?</h3>
<div class="what">
  <p id=what>The locks are multiple sets of retractable dams intended to reduce the enviromental impact caused by the construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal through two goals. The first is minimizing the cross contamination between the fresh water of Lake Washington and the Salt Water of the Puget Sound. The second is minimizing the distance which Lake Washingtons water level decreases relative to the Sound. It also seeks to allow ships to travel from Lake Washington to the Puget Sound while accomplishing those two goals. It does this by only allowing a set amount of water to pass from one body of water into the lock at the same time.<br /><br />

<h3>Why would I go see some shipping port when the space needle is so near?</h3>
<div class="why">
  <p >The Ballard Locks are host to a wide variety of different community <a href="http://ballardlocks.org/events.html">events</a> such as <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/events/25136869/2017-chittenden-locks-summer-concert-series">concerts</a> and Lock Talks, an upcoming series of presentations and demonstrations about all manner of lock related subjects, such as History, Culture, Salmon and Engineering. Even when there are no special events planned the Locks are still known for their scenic views and rolling hills perfect for picnics. Nearby, the salmon ladder serves as an intriguing scientific curiousity which is engaging and educational. The ladder teaches visitors about the life cycle of salmon and why such an odd structure is neccesary to conserve the natural order of the Puget Sound. </p>
